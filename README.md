## Contributing

Contributions should be submitted as UTF-8 encoded CSV files to the appropriate provider directory (for example `chatgpt-text/`, `chatgpt-image/`, etc.). Each CSV must have the exact header (first line):

prompt,contributor,comment

Rules:
- Header order must be exactly: prompt,contributor,comment
- Each CSV row is a single prompt entry.
- Fields that contain commas, double quotes, or newlines must be wrapped in double quotes.
- Escape double quotes by doubling them (e.g., "He said ""hello""").
- Use a short contributor handle (e.g., @alice) or `@curated` for curated entries in the contributor field.
- Keep comment as a short tag or note (optional).
- Preserve newlines inside quoted fields for multiline prompts.

Example row:
"Summarize the following article:\n[article text]",@alice,"summarization"

Workflow:
1. Create or update a CSV file in the appropriate provider directory following the rules above.
2. Open a pull request that explains the prompt’s purpose, model tested against, and any results you observed.
3. Use descriptive filenames and organize prompts by intent or category where helpful.
4. Reviewers may reformat or reject submissions that do not follow the CSV rules.

This format ensures consistent, machine-readable contributions and makes it easy to curate and import prompts programmatically.
